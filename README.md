# sudoku
I once got humiliated by a hard sudoku on the screen at the back of an airplane 
seat. I built this program to avenge me. It does it well.

# to run
Write your sudoku problem in sudoku_input.txt. An example is provided for you.
You may then call ``stack run`` and observe the result in the standard output.
Easy sudokus are solved instantly, very hard ones in a few seconds.

This requires [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/), the main 
Haskell package manager/build tool.

Note : Your first build might require an internet connection to 
download library deps.
